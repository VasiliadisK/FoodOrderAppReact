# FoodOrderAppReact
This project is a training project to create a front based food ordering app (with a dummy backend) to test my newly studied knowledge using react. 
The backend is not the prime focus of this project so it is as basic as it can get.
The orders are stored in a file in the backend instead of a normal database schema.
